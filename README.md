## Unsupervised Machine Learning: PCA & Clustering - US Arrests Dataset

In this project, unsupervised machine learning is applied on the US arrest dataset from 1973.

</br>The main focus was to leverage Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & two different clustering methods (agglomerative hierarchical clustering & K-means clustering) to gain insights into which US states were likely to be relatively safe to live in (if we were to move within the US in 1973).

</br>The dataset has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurohana/usarrets) & the csv file is included again here in this repo.

**What does it do?**
</br>The repo essentially consists of a Jupyter notebook and the aforementioned csv raw data file.
The code within the Jupyter notebook leverages well-known Python libraries, such as:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

</br>These modules usually come standard, for example, when Python3 is downloaded through [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/).
If not, please don't forget to install them (e.g. pip install).

**Who is this for?**
</br>Like myself, anyone who is new at data science & ML. I'm more than happy to collaborate or if you simply want to use the code as an example or for other learning purposes.

**Last Note**
</br>This project was the last capstone project, which was completed as part of a 16-week Data Science bootcamp offered by [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
Like I just mentioned above, I'm keen to collaborate & exchange ideas about data science & ML. For queries about the bootcamp content & curriculum, please contact HyperionDev directly.
</br>I hope you'll find the code useful.
### Thanks a lot!
